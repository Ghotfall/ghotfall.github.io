[{"title":"About","date":"July 19, 2020","description":"A little bit about myself","body":"Introduction Hello, everybody! My name is Andrii, but most people here know me as Ghotfall.\nThe main purpose of this blog is to share interesting stories about my life, work and hobbies!\nI am a student from Ukraine, I live in Vinnitsa now. It\u0026rsquo;s not my hometown, my real home is 550 km away from here, near the Black Sea, but now I visit it quite rarely.\nA little bit about study and work I\u0026rsquo;m studying to be a software engineer. I\u0026rsquo;m interested in programming since 8th class, when I started creating simple websites on HTML and CSS. Next two years I was improving my skills: I learned more about JS, PHP, even had some practise with MySQL - all this stuff was used for creating more complex websites.\nBut by the end of 10th class I was a little bit tired of all this \u0026ldquo;web things\u0026rdquo;. In addition, that time was the beggining of wave of JS-frameworks like Angular and React, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in them. In result, I switched to C++ and had some experience with OpenGL (nothing special, just few hobby projects).\nBy now my main programming languages are Java, Kotlin and Golang. Yes, time changed a lot of stuff. Java and Kotlin are used by me for university projects and development on Android. And Golang is used for my work - I am working as DevOps besides studing in university, so I already have experience with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP and some other stuff.\nHobbies In free time I like drawing. I have only around a year of experience, but I have already tried both traditional and digital drawing.\nCheck it!\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Andrij Mirgorodskij (@ghotfall) on Jul 19, 2020 at 2:21am PDT\n     View this post on Instagram         A post shared by Andrij Mirgorodskij (@ghotfall) on May 21, 2020 at 9:28am PDT\n  ","ref":"/about/"}]
