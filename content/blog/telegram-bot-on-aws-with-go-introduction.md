Telegram bots make our life simpler every day. They can be used to solve a wide variety of tasks, from entertainments in your spare time to automation of your work routine.

You can easily make your own bot using Golang and then host it on AWS Lambda and API Gateway, which would be quite cheap (or even free, if your resources usage stay under AWS Free Tier limits). Serverless computing is very usefull for this kind of tasks!
