My name is Andrii, but most people here know me as Ghotfall.
The main purpose of this blog is to share interesting stories about my life, work and hobbies!
I am a student from Ukraine, I live in Vinnitsa now. It&amp;rsquo;s not my hometown, my real home is 550 km away from here, near the Black Sea, but now I visit it quite rarely.
A little bit about study and work I&amp;rsquo;m studying to be a software engineer.</description></item></channel></rss>
